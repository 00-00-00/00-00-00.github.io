      <description>Arjun here. I am very interested in observing and building systems, be it software systems or a motorcycle engine. Spinning a spanner is one of the most satisfactory feeling. So is when modules interact seamlessly with each other. I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly worked on Android codebases. I am learning about design patterns for software architecture, Restful APIs, databases and website development.
I like really long cross country motorcycle tours. They say that one who travels is the one who learns the most.</description>

      <description>The objective is to write an android application that will fetch some data over the network, store it locally and display the data in a list-detail format.
Since we want to try avoiding couping. We will try adopting the Observer Patter i.e. we&amp;rsquo;ll have modules that emit events and other modules react to to the event. We can use RxJava for a publish-subscribe mechanism. Since we are using RxJava on Android, RxAndroid which provides us nifty Schedulers for managing the threads.</description>

      <description>Around May of last year Android introduced a bunch of new classes around organising code better. Till then Android team never really took a stand to tell the community how to organise their codebases. What I observed was activities started developing unwieldy View classes (Activities and Fragments) that did everything from spawning new threads, making network calls, performing disk writes to anything and everything you could require the application to do.</description>
